    <h2>Institution</h2>
    <p class="p" align="justify">
        Higher Education for rural students was a dream at that time. This dream came true in the year 1967. The leaders of Ranebennur and surrounding villages, with their constant endeavor and efforts, established the “Ranebennur Taluka Education Society under the presidentship of Sri.V.K.Sawkar veteran social worker from Maidur in the year 1966.
         Sri.K B Koliwad at present the Honorable minister for Rural Water supply and Engineering Division of Rural Development Govt. of Karnataka has been advising as Honorary Secretary for the society since 1966. R.T.E.Society’s Arts and Science College came into existence in the year 1967. The College started its academic activities at a small municipal building with a few number of teachers. Dr.K G Shastri was the first principal of the college had given a strong foundation to the Institution. <br>

Just within a short period after the establishment of the college, students from Rural & Urban areas in a large number, started to get education. It was highly impossible for teachers and members of the society to manage the students in a small accommodation, In the year 1967, a Philanthropist Shri Bristappa Naik with his two liberal daughters Kumari Puspa & Shoba Bistappa Naik with their bounty had donated about 28 acres of land for the erection of new college building to uplift education for boys and girls of Ranebennur Taluka.

The foundation stone for independent college building and campus was laid on 28 acres of land in the year 1969 by his Holiness Shri Satya Saibaba of Putaparthi of Andhra Pradesh. Dr. A.S. Adke, the Vice-Chancellor of Karnataka University was also present on that occasion.

The new college building was inaugurated by Dr.(Smt.) P Selvidas, the Director for Collegiate Education, Bangalore on 12th December, 1986. Sri.H K Patil, MLC and Sri. K B Koliwad, Honorary Secretary of the R T E Society were also present on that occasion. Now the college has its own independent Administrative, Academic and Library buildings. The R.T.E.Society is firmly committees to provide infrastructural facilities in the college. Now it has spacious and functional Teaching Blocks, Sri V.K. Sawkar Auditorium, Independent Departmental Blocks, Sri V.K. Sawkar Auditorium, Independent Departmental Blocks for physics, Chemistry Botany, Zoology, Geography, Computer Science. College amenities, well equipped laboratories, vast playground,etc. <br>

The College has been recognized under U.G.C. scheme 2f and 12b in the year1982. It has been the philosophy and policy of the society to start vocationally useful courses of study in place of routine courses. With this view the society has introduced the Seed Technology course in the year 1996-97 to cater the need of the seeds growing companies around the Ranebennur town. <br>
Apart from routine and conventional courses, the society has started Computer Education to students during the year 2000-2001. This computer department is well equipped with 18 computers and well qualified staff.

In order to provide education, in particular to the rural boys and girls, the society has started R.T.E.S’ Pre-University Colege and R.T.E.S’ Law College in Ranebennur, it has also started Smt.Kamalamma High School at Gudagur of Ranebennur Taluk. The Government of Karnataka has sanctioned R.T.E.S.College of Education R.T.E.S. B.Sc Nursing and R.T.E.S’ School Of Nursing which are likely to be started from the Academic year 2004-05

R.T.E.Society’s Arts, Science and Commerce College has been recognized as the lead college in haveri District by the Commissioner of Collegiate Education Bangalore in the year 2003-04. So the strength of the students has been increasing year after year and present it is increased to 1276 students, having 36 well qualifies and experienced teaching staff and 14 administrative staff.

The College has got reputation for its talented students over the last 36 years. Some talented have got two Gold medals and brought name & fame by securing ranks in different courses.

<h3>History</h3>
<p class="p">After independence the University Grants Commission, headed by S. Radhakrishnan, recommended the introduction of voluntary national service in academic institutions. This idea was again considered by the Central Advisory Board of Education (CABE) at its meeting in January, 1950; after examining the idea and the experiences of other countries in this field, the board recommended that students and teachers should devote time to voluntary manual work. In the draft, the first Five-Year Plan adopted by the government in 1952 and the need for social and labour service by Indian students for one year was stressed. In 1958Jawaharlal Nehru, in a letter to the chief ministers, considered the idea of social service as a prerequisite for graduation. He directed the Ministry of Education to formulate a suitable scheme for the introduction of national service into academic institutions.</p>
<h3>Coverage:</h3>
<p class="p">Started initially in 37 universities involving 40,000 volunteers, the scheme has grown over the years and it is implemented today with an involvement of more than 3.8 million volunteers spread over in 396 Universities, Polytechnics and 47 Councils of +2 level. The efforts of NSS volunteers have been widely acclaimed by the community, universities, colleges and general public as the NSS volunteers have been rendering selfless service to the community.</p>
<h3>Motto:</h3>
<p class="p">The Motto of NSS “Not Me But You”, reflects the essence of democratic living and upholds the need for self-less service. NSS helps the student’s development & appreciation to other person’s point of view and also show consideration towards other living beings. The philosophy of the NSS is a good doctrine in this motto, which underlines on the belief that the welfare of an individual is ultimately dependent on the welfare of the society as a whole and therefore, the NSS volunteers shall strive for the well-being of the society.</p>
<h3>NSS Logo:</h3>
<p class="p">The logo for the NSS has been based on the giant Rath Wheel of the world famous Konark Sun Temple (The Black Pagoda) situated in Orissa, India. The Red & Blue colors contained in the logo motivate the NSS Volunteers to be active & energetic for the nation-building social activities. The wheel portrays the cycle of creation, preservation and release and signifies the movement in life across time and space, The wheel thus stands for continuity as well as change and implies the continuous striving of NSS for social change.</p>
<h3>NSS Badge:</h3>
<p class="p">The NSS logo is embossed on the badge of NSS. The eight bars in the wheel of NSS logo represent the 24 hours of a day. The red color indicates that the volunteer is full of young blood that is lively, active, energetic and full of high spirit. The navy blue colour indicates the cosmos of which the NSS is tiny part, ready to contribute its share for the welfare of the mankind.</p>
<h3>AIM</h3>
<p class="p">The programme aims to instilling the idea of social welfare in students, and to provide service to society without bias. NSS volunteers work to ensure that everyone who is needy gets help to enhance their standard of living and lead a life of dignity. In doing so, volunteers learn from people in villages how to lead a good life despite a scarcity of resources. it also provides help in natural and man-made disasters by providing food, clothing and first aid to the disaster’s victims.</p>
<h3>Financial Arrangements:</h3>
<p class="p">The scheme is now a central sector scheme to organize Regular Activities (RA) and special Camping Programmes (SCPs). An amount of Rs.250/-per volunteer per annum is released towards Regular Activities (RAs) and Rs.450/- per volunteer per Special Camping Programme (SCP) which is of 7-days duration to be organized in the adopted villages/urban slums. In addition, the Government of India provides 100% financial assistance to run NSS Regional Directorates, State NSS Cells & Empaneled Training Institute (ETI).
NSS Units of the college: Our college has two active NSS units for boys and girls.The units on routine basis carryout various outreach programs for social good of the society.</p> <br>
